## How to contribute

Contributions to the package are very welcome. Please get in touch (preferable by opening a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/ethanbass/chromatographR/issues)) to discuss any 
suggestions or to file a bug report. Some good reasons to file an issue:

- You found an actual bug.
- You're getting a cryptic error message that you don't understand.
- You have a file format you'd like to read that isn't currently supported by chromatographR. (If you do this, please make sure to include a link to an example file!)
- You have a new feature you'd like to see implemented.

### Reporting Bugs

- Please check existing issues before filing a bug report.

- If you're bug hasn't yet been reported, please include as many details as possible,
including preferably a code snippet that can be used to reproduce the issue and any
error messages that are printed to the console.

- Please include the version of `chromatographR` that you are running. Version information can be obtained
from your R session by running `packageVersion("chromatographR")`.
