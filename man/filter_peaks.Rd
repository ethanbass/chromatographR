\title{Filter peak lists}
\usage{
filter_peaks(peak_list, min_height, min_area, min_sd, max_sd, min_rt, max_rt)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_list}{A peak_list object, consisting of a nested list of peak
tables, where the first level is the sample, and the second level is the 
spectral component. Every component is described by a matrix where every row 
is one peak, and the columns contain information on retention time, 
full width at half maximum (FWHM), peak width, height, and area.}

\item{min_height}{Minimum peak height.}

\item{min_area}{Minimum peak area.}

\item{min_sd}{Minimal standard deviation.}

\item{max_sd}{Maximum standard deviation.}

\item{min_rt}{Minimum retention time.}

\item{max_rt}{Maximum retention time.}
}
\value{
A peak list similar to the input, with all rows removed
from that do not satisfy the specified criteria.
}
\description{
Utility function to remove peaks from a peak list (e.g., because their
intensity is too low). Currently one can filter on peak height, peak area,
standard deviation, and/or retention time.
