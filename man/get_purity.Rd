\title{Calculate mean peak purity}
\usage{
get_purity(
  x,
  pos,
  weight = 1,
  cutoff = 0.05,
  noise_variance = NULL,
  noise_threshold = 0.01,
  lambdas,
  try = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A chromatogram in matrix format}

\item{pos}{A vector containing the center, lower and upper bounds of a peak
as numeric indices.}

\item{weight}{Weight provided to \code{\link{get_agilent_threshold}}.}

\item{cutoff}{Proportion of maximum absorbance to use as cutoff.
Argument to \code{\link{trim_peak}}.}

\item{noise_variance}{Variance of noise. Argument to \code{\link{get_agilent_threshold}}.}

\item{noise_threshold}{Threshold to define noise. Highest proportion of maximum absorbance.}

\item{lambdas}{Wavelengths to include in calculations.}

\item{try}{Logical. Whether to estimate the purity or not. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns the mean purity of the peak specified by \code{pos}, defined
as the proportion of timepoints with purity values below 1.
}
\description{
Estimates peak purity by assessing the dissimilarity of the spectra
comprising the peak, using the method described in Stahl 2003.
