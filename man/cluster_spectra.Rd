\usage{
cluster_spectra(
  peak_table,
  peak_no = c(5, 100),
  alpha = 0.95,
  nboot = 1000,
  plot_dend = TRUE,
  plot_spectra = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_table}{Peak table from \code{\link{get_peaktable}}.}

\item{peak_no}{Minimum and maximum thresholds for the number of peaks a
cluster may have.}

\item{alpha}{Confidence threshold for inclusion of cluster.}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap replicates for
\code{\link[pvclust:pvclust]{pvclust}}.}

\item{plot_dend}{Logical. If TRUE, plots dendrogram with bootstrap values.}

\item{plot_spectra}{Logical. If TRUE, plots overlapping spectra for each
cluster.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress report to console.}

\item{save}{Logical. If TRUE, saves pvclust object to current directory.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. If TRUE, use parallel processing for
\code{\link[pvclust:pvclust]{pvclust}}.}

\item{max.only}{Logical. If TRUE, returns only highest level for nested
dendrograms.}

\item{output}{What to return. Either \code{clusters} to return list of clusters,
\code{pvclust} to return pvclust object, or \code{both} to return both items.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \code{\link[pvclust:pvclust]{pvclust}}.}
}
\value{
Returns clusters and/or \code{pvclust} object according to the value
of the \code{output} argument.
\itemize{
\item If \code{output = clusters},  returns a list of S4 \code{cluster} objects.
\item If \code{output = pvclust}, returns a \code{\link[pvclust:pvclust]{pvclust}}
object.
\item If \code{output = both}, returns a nested list containing \code{[[1]]} the
\code{\link[pvclust:pvclust]{pvclust}} object, and \code{[[2]]} the list of
S4 \code{cluster} objects.
}

The \code{cluster} objects consist of the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{peaks}: a character vector containing the names
of all peaks contained in the given cluster.
\item \code{pval}: a numeric vector of length 1 containing
the bootstrap p-value (au) for the given cluster.
}
}
\description{
Function to cluster peaks by spectral similarity. A representative spectrum
is selected for each peak in the provided peak table and used to construct a
distance matrix based on spectral similarity (pearson correlation) between
peaks. Hierarchical clustering with bootstrap resampling is performed on the resulting
correlation matrix to classify peaks into by their spectral similarity.
}
\details{
A representative spectrum is selected for each peak in the provided peak table
and used to construct a distance matrix based on spectral similarity
(pearson correlation) between peaks. It is suggested to attach representative
spectra to the \code{peak_table} using \code{\link{attach_ref_spectra}}.
Otherwise, representative spectra are obtained from the chromatogram with the
highest absorbance at lambda max.

Hierarchical clustering with bootstrap
resampling is performed on the resulting correlation matrix, as implemented in
\code{\link[pvclust:pvclust]{pvclust}}. Finally, bootstrap values can be used
to select clusters that exceed a certain confidence threshold as defined by
\code{alpha}. Clusters can also be filtered by the minimum and maximum
size of the cluster using the argument \code{peak_no}. If \code{max_only}
is TRUE, only the largest cluster in a nested dendrogram of clusters meeting
the confidence threshold will be returned.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Users should be aware that the clustering algorithm will often return nested
clusters. Thus, an individual peak could appear in more than one cluster.
\item It is highly suggested to use more than 100 bootstraps if you run the
clustering algorithm on real data even though we use \code{nboot = 100} in
the example to reduce runtime. The authors of \code{pvclust} suggest \code{
nboot = 10000}.
