  abstract = {A colony of social insects is like a fortress where access is allowed only to colony members. The epicuticular mixture of hydrocarbons has been widely reported to be involved in nestmate recognition in insects. However, recent studies have shown that polar compounds (mainly peptides) are also present, mixed with hydrocarbons, on the cuticle of various insects, including the paper wasps of the genus Polistes. As these polar compounds are variable among Polistes species and are perceived by the wasps, this cuticular fraction could also be involved in nestmate recognition. Through MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight) mass spectrometry analysis, we assessed, for the first time, the intercolonial variability of the cuticular polar fraction of Polistes dominulus in order to evaluate its reliability as source of nestmate recognition cues. We then tested through behavioral assays the importance of the 2 isolated fractions (apolar and polar) in nestmate recognition by presenting them separately to colonies of P. dominulus. Our results showed that the cuticular polar compounds are not colony specific and they are not used by paper wasps to discriminate nestmates from non-colony members. On the contrary, we confirmed that the isolated cuticular hydrocarbons are the chemical mediators prompting nestmate recognition in paper wasps.},

  abstract = {Nestmate discrimination in social wasps has been documentedamongspring foundresses, fall gynes, workers,males, and nestmatesof the opposite sex. In addition, foundresses of P. fuscatus can discriminate kin fromnon-kinbrood. Without exception, nestmates/kin are moretolerant of each other than are non-nestmates/non-kin.Moreover,preferential tolerance of adult nestmatesis apparently not due to differences in size betweennestmatesand non-nestmates (47, 58). Nestmate discrimination has been documentedin six temperate species of social wasps from three genera and two subfamilies. Thus, nestmate discriminationability appearsto be widespreadin at least temperatesocial wasps. P. gallicus is the only species of social waspin whichnestmate recognition ability has been studied but not documented.Becauseof Pratte's (52) experimental protocol (see Spring Foundresses),the nestmaterecognition ability of P. gallicus should be reinvestigated. In any event, the failure to document recognition ability doesnot necessarily establish the lack of such ability, but rather maysimplyreflect the insensitivity of a particular assayfor detection of recognitionability.},

The assays consisted of switching sister colonies and recording whether aunts accepted or rejected their non-nestmate nieces. Hexane extracts of each female were then analysed with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. A step-wise discriminant function analysis (DFA) was conducted to predict behavioural outcomes (accept or reject) on the basis of differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Ten cuticular hydrocarbons were included in the highly significant (P=0{$\cdot$}0015) linear discriminant function. They consisted primarily of methyl-branched alkanes, which were relatively colony-specific, and straight-chain alkanes, which were less colony-specific. A jack-knifed procedure resulted in a 100\% correct classification of all nieces to the accept or reject behavioural group.},

  abstract = {Polistes are an ideal system to study ultimate and proximate questions of dominance, and to test theoretical predictions about social evolution. The behaviors typically associated with dominance in Polistes are similar to those observed in many vertebrate societies. Here, we review recent ethological, mechanistic, and evolutionary studies on how social dominance hierarchies are established and maintained in Polistes spp. From the ultimate perspective, we address individual and group benefits of hierarchy formation, as well as issues such as reproductive skew, queen-worker conflict, and costs of challenging the dominant. From the proximate perspective, we review social, physical, and physiological factors influencing hierarchy formation, including co-foundress interactions, age structure, body size, endocrine system, and chemical and visual signals. We also discuss the extensive inter- and intra-specific variation of Polistes in the formation and maintenance of hierarchies, as well as levels of within-colony aggression. We conclude the review by highlighting the utility of this variation for comparative studies and the immense potential of the genus Polistes to address fundamental and unanswered questions about the evolution and maintenance of dominance behavior in animals.},

  abstract = {Independent origins of sociality in bees and ants are associated with independent expansions of particular odorant receptor (OR) gene subfamilies. In ants, one clade within the OR gene family, the 9-exon subfamily, has dramatically expanded. These receptors detect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), key social signaling molecules in insects. It is unclear to what extent 9-exon OR subfamily expansion is associated with the independent evolution of sociality across Hymenoptera, warranting studies of taxa with independently derived social behavior. Here, we describe OR gene family evolution in the northern paper wasp, Polistes fuscatus, and compare it to four additional paper wasp species spanning {$\sim$}40 million years of evolutionary divergence. We find 200 putatively functional OR genes in P.~fuscatus, matching predictions from neuroanatomy, and more than half of these are in the 9-exon subfamily. Most OR gene expansions are tandemly arrayed at orthologous loci in Polistes genomes, and microsynteny analysis shows species-specific gain and loss of 9-exon ORs within tandem arrays. There is evidence of episodic positive diversifying selection shaping ORs in expanded subfamilies. Values of omega (dN/dS) are higher among 9-exon ORs compared to other OR subfamilies. Within the Polistes OR gene tree, branches in the 9-exon OR clade experience relaxed negative (relaxed purifying) selection relative to other branches in the tree. Patterns of OR evolution within Polistes are consistent with 9-exon OR function in CHC perception by combinatorial coding, with both natural selection and neutral drift contributing to interspecies differences in gene copy number and sequence.},

Unmated females were attracted to hexane extracts of males and to hexane extracts of each body tagma of males, suggesting distribution of the pheromone over the cuticle by grooming. The ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands are the likely sources of the male-produced sex attractant(s) since extracts of each elicited female attraction in the flight tunnel. These glands are associated with gastral and mandibular rubbing of perch sites by territorial males ofPolistes species.},
